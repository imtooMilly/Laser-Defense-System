# Laser-Defense-System 🎇

Pew Pew!!!

This is meant to be a fun little harmless project for those who enjoy interactive gadgets, get easily distracted, or need a fun little tool to keep their pets entertained. Our Laser Defence System offers an immersive experience, allowing users to control a laser beam in real-time through the use of two modes: manual and auto-sensing mode.

## Manual Sensing Mode 🕹

In manual sensing mode, the user is in full control. By using the joystick, the laser beam’s orientation will change accordingly. In addition, users also have the option to change the laser’s intensity(size of the beam). This allows users to have a hands-on experience that they will never forget. Every action and input is deliberate and impactful, making those inner mad scientist dreams come to fruition.  

## Auto Sensing Mode

For those who don’t need that kind of control and want a more relaxing experience, the auto-sensing mode provides that as it does the work for you. Its built-in sensors will scan the environment and find suitable targets to shoot its beam. Everything is automatic and seamless leaving no room for user intervention. If you are ever bored or can’t entertain your pet then this is the mode for you.

## To Conclude 🏁

Overall, this project is meant to entertain you the user with a little touch of software development and engineering. We hope you have fun interacting with this piece of technology.
